try to find description ...The 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) constitutes a major site of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Sequence elements in the 3'UTR interact with trans-acting regulators such as microRNAs that affect translation and stability. The overall aim is to use a 3'RACE cloning-sequencing stragety to identify the 3'UTRs of C. elegans transcripts and explore their heterogeneity in different developmental stages and tissues.  These submissions represent the samples prepared for downstream analysis by various sequencing and annotation techniques. done
