try to find description ...We aim to determine the locations of 125 chromosomal proteins across
the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The proteins under study are
involved in basic chromosomal functions such as DNA replication, gene
expression, gene silencing, and inheritance. We will perform Chromatin
ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) using genomic tiling arrays. We will
initially assay localizations using chromatin from three cell lines
and two embryonic stages, and will then extend the analysis of a
subset of proteins to four additional animal tissues/stages done
