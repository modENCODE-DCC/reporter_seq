try to find description ...We aim to determine the locations of the major histone modifications
across the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The modifications under
study are involved in basic chromosomal functions such as DNA
replication, gene expression, gene silencing, and inheritance. We will
perform Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) using genomic tiling
arrays. We will initially assay localizations using chromatin from
three cell lines and two embryonic stages, and will then extend the
analysis of a subset of proteins to four additional animal tissues/stages. done
