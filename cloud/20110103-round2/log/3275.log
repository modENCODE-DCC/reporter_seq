try to find description ...To validate models of Drosophila transcription, we isolated cDNAs from a cDNA library by targeted screening. The basis of this protocol, 'self-ligation of inverse PCR products' (SLIP), is a rapid and efficient method for capturing plasmid cDNAs.  Targeted screening efficiently recovers rare and alternative transcripts. Sequencing cDNAs, identifies 5' and 3' UTRs. done
