try to find description ...We report a significant number of miRNAs and other non-coding small RNAs show dramatic changes in expression under various stress conditions in C. elegans. RNAs were prepared C. elegans hermaphrodites, under starvation, bacterial exposure, and heat shock stresses, and used for making cDNA libraries for small RNAs. Each library was sequenced using recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technology, Solexa. done
