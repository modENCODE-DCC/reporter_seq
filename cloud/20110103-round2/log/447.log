try to find description ...This experiment identifies intron boundary coordinates in C. elegans
genomic sequence. Initially, we run genefinder to predict protein-coding
transcripts from the C. elegans chromosome sequences. We align
existing cDNA and EST sequences to the predicted transcript sequences
to confirm the transcript structure. Predicted splice junctions
unconfirmed by these alignments are tested for confirmation using
RT-PCR, DNA sequencing, and sequence alignment. These PCR experiments
use gene-specific/gene-specific, 5' RACE/gene-specific, and
gene-specific/3' RACE primer pairs. done
