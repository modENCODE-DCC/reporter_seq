try to find description ...The 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) constitutes a major site of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Sequence elements in the 3'UTR interact with trans-acting regulators such as microRNAs that affect translation and stability. The overall aim is to use a 3'RACE cloning-sequencing stragety to identify the 3'UTRs of C. elegans transcripts and explore their heterogeneity in different developmental stages and tissues. done
