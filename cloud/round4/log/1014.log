try to find description ...The goal of these experiments are to identify splicing events that are regulated by specific RNA binding proteins in Drosophila S2 cells.  From this collection of regulated exons, we will identify motifs that are enriched in and/or around the regulated exons and are therefore the best candidates for being recognized by the RNA binding protein.  To do this, we are using RNAi to deplete individual RNA binding protein mRNAs from Drosophila S2-DRSC cells and then using RNA-Seq to characterize the resulting transcriptome.  Comparison of the transcriptome from depleted cells to that of un-depleted cells will allow us to identify regulated splicing events. done
