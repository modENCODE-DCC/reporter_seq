try to find description ...RNA-seq was performed on polyA-RNA for developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster on which ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq has been performed. The RNA was isolated from the same material used for ChIP experiments and, after purification and production of the Solexa libraries, sequenced (single-end) at Argonne National Lab. For RNA-seq, 2 lanes per sample are bieng run. done
