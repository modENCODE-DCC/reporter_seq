try to find title ...small RNAs from living one cell C. elegans embryos (GSM427345) done
try to find description ...We devised a method to collect various staged C. elegans embryos by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (eFACS).  We combined eFACS with second-generation sequencing to profile the embryonic expression of small, noncoding RNAs.   We aim to discover complex changes in the expression between and within almost all classes of small rnAs, including micrornAs and 26G-RNAs, during embryogenesis. done
