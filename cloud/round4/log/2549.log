try to find title ...CAGE sequencing of mixed embryo 5' ends done
try to find description ...To map transcription start sites (TSSs) genome-wide, we perform CAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene Expression). These CAGE tags are 27-nt sequences that are derived from mRNAs and other long capped transcripts in the vicinity of the 5' cap site. Their mapping onto the genome sequence defines TSSs. CAGE libraries are constructed from first-strand cDNA selected through a biotinylated cap. Second-strand synthesis is dependent upon ligation to the first-strand full-length cDNA of a primer that contains a restriction site for a type II endonuclease allowing the cleavage of 5' 27-bp tags from the resulting cDNA. These short fragments are sequenced using the Illumina GA platform. done
