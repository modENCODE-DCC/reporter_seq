try to find description ...We are using Paired-end RNA-Seq to characterize the transcriptome in various Drosophila cell lines.  For each cell line, total RNA is isolated, subjected to two rounds of poly(A)+ selection, and then used to make paired-end RNA-Seq libraries.  We then sequence each library using an Illumina Genome Analyzer. done
