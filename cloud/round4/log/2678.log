try to find title ...D.melanogaster 4-6hr embryo, SOLiD total RNA-seq done
try to find description ...Strand-specific RNA-seq analysis was performed on 12 total RNA samples in a time course spanning the development of the D. melanogaster embryo, from 0-2hr through 22-24hr in two-hour windows. RNA was isolated by the Peter Cherbas group. Library construction, RNA-seq producution (50 nt reads), data processing and genomic alignment were performed by Applied Biosystems using the SOLID platform and software. done
