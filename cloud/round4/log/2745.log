try to find title ...Annotation of CEUP 3' UTRs, polyA sites, and PAS sites done
try to find description ...Multiple independent evidence sources supporting the existence of 3'UTR isoforms were collected, aligned to the genome, and curated as previously described. Four main types of data sources were used, including CEUP 3' RACE clones, CEUP polyA capture, AceView curated cDNA and EST traces from the Yuji Kohara collection, Exelixis and the NCBI Trace Archive, and GenBank entries, and Published RNAseq transcriptome profiling data from Hillier et al., Genome Res 2009. Here we annotate 3'UTRs, polyA sites, and PAS motifs. done
