try to find description ...In order to identify 26G endo-siRNAs that regulate spermatogenic and zygotic gene expression in C. elegans, we isolated small RNAs (18-32nt) that were expressed in purified male sperm, hermaphrodite oocytes, embryos, N2, glp-4(bn2), and eri-1(mg366) worms.  These RNAs were cloned and sequenced by 454 and Illumina high-throughput sequencing, followed by alignments to the C. elegans genome. done
