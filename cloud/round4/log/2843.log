try to find description ...Using massively parallel sequencing by synthesis methods, we are surveying transcripts from various stages, tissues and conditions of the nematode C. elegans. We use novel statistical approaches to evaluate coverage of annotated features of the genome and of candidate processed transcripts.   We then provide lists of evidence of level of expression per transcript and catalogs of confirmed splice junctions, trans-spliced leader sequences, start sites, end sites, and poly-adenylation tracts for each stage/tissue/condition. done
