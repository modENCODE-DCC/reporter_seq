try to find description ...RNA-seq analysis was performed on poly(A)+ RNA from 30 developmental stages spanning the life cycle of D. melanogaster, from 0-2hr embryos through 30-day male and female adults. Total RNA was isolated by the Peter Cherbas group. Isolation of poly(A)+ RNA and library construction were performed in the Brenton Graveley lab. Libraries were distributed among 5 labs in the Drosophila Transcriptome group for sequencing.  The Susan Celniker lab performed paired-end sequencing exclusively (2x76 nt) .  The Brenton Graveley, Tom Gingeras and Michael Brent labs performed single-end sequencing exclusively (1x76 nt).  The Brian Oliver lab performed both single- and paired-end sequencing.  All labs used the same Illumina GAII platform and called bases using the Illumina processing pipeline.  Fastaq files were generated using pipeline version 1.3 before 5/07/09 and using version 1.4 after that date. Reads were aligned to the genome sequence using Tophat v.1.0.10. done
