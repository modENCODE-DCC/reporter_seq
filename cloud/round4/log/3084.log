try to find description ...To provide biological validation of D. melanogaster transcript models, we will generate RNA-Seq profiles for other members of the genus, using timepoints and tissue samples matching those being generated for D. melanogaster.  Evolutionary conservation of expression will be valuable support for annotation efforts. done
