try to find description ...Our experiments are designed to detect all C. elegans transcripts by hybridizing RNA to commercially available genome tiling arrays. To understand how bacterial pathogens taken up by C. elegans may affect transcription, we grew young adult worms on various pathogenic bacterial strains for either 24 or 48 hours and measured transcription levels.  Simultaneously, young adult worms were also grown on non-pathogenic bacteria (OP50) as controls. done
