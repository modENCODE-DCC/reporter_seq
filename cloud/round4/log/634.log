try to find description ...We aim to examine the changes in expression of non-coding small RNAs, including miRNAs and piRNAs/21U-RNAs, during development and aging, and in the different sexes of C. elegans using high-throughput sequencing technology Solexa. Additionally, we will identify novel small RNAs, especially novel miRNA candidates. done
