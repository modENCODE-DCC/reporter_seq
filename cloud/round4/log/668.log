try to find title ...Kc167 Replication Timing done
try to find description ...The relative time of replication for all unique sequences in the Drosophila genome was determined by synchronizing tissue culture cell and differentially labeling early and late replicating intermediates. The differentially labeled replication intermediates were then hybridized to Agilent genomic tiling arrays to identify early and late replicating domains. done
