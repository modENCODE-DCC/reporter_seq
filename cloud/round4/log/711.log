try to find title ...ML-DmBG3-c2 Replication Origins done
try to find description ...Early origins of replication were identified by treating cells with hydroxyurea (HU), a potent inhibitor of nucleotide synthesis, in the presence of the nucleotide analogue BrdU.  Treatment of synchronized cells with HU stalls replication forks and activates the intra S-phase checkpoint, thereby limiting BrdU incorporation to those sequences immediately adjacent to early activating replication origins. BrdU enriched sequences surrounding early origins of replication are then enriched by immunoprecipitation with an anti-BrdU antibody.  Early origins are then detected by hybridization to Agilent genomic tiling arrays. done
