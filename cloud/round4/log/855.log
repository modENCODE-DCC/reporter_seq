try to find description ...The White Lab is aiming to map the association of all the Transcription Factors (TF) and DNA associated proteins on the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. The main technique that will be used for this purpose is chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip (ChIP-on-chip) utilizing whole-genome tiling arrays. The data generated by ChIP-chip experiments consist basically of a plot of signal intensity across the genome. The highest signals correspond to positions in the genome occupied by the tested TF.
ChIP-seq, meaning direct sequencing of the ChIP sample on the Solexa platform, has also been used to validate some datasets and will become- as the project advances- the main production platform.

To support ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq datasets, and in order to link association of factors to the DNA with regulation of transcription, several RNA-seq (direct sequencing of the transcriptome on the Solexa platform) datasets will be genrated for the time-points under scrutiny. done
