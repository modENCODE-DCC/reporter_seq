try to find description ...The White Lab is aiming to map the association of many of the
non-histone chromosomal proteins on the genome of Drosophila
melanogaster. One technique that we use for this purpose is chromatin
immunoprecipitation-on-chip (ChIP-on-chip) utilizing whole-genome
tiling arrays. The data generated by ChIP-chip experiments consist
basically of a plot of signal intensity across the genome. The highest
signals correspond to positions in the genome occupied by the tested
chromatin-binding protein. done
